To use the Database class, create a Database object with db = Database, and then run any of the available commands in the main function, with db as the first parameter passed through. The example workflow defined in the assignment is pre written in the main function. To run the file, run "python ./transaction.py" in the terminal.

One idea I have for this assignment is to simulate distributed storage. Simulate storing one piece of data on one database and having a backup of that data on another database. So in a situation of 3 databases, you can destory one random database and stil retain all information if you stored that information in any two databases.
